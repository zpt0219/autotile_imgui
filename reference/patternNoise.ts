// patternNoise.ts — optional grain on a pattern's transition band.
//
// Every algorithm here is a PURE function of (x, y) taken modulo the 16px
// pattern tile. That is not a stylistic choice: a tile is painted without any
// knowledge of its neighbours, so a post-process that reads nearby pixels would
// disagree with itself across a seam. Being per-pixel and 16-periodic makes the
// grain a function of global position, which is exactly what keeps the tileset
// seamless. Anything added here must keep both properties.
//
// The grain is applied only to levels 1..3 — the transition band. Levels 0 and
// 4 are the solid terrains and stay clean.
